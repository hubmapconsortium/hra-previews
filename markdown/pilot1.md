# Preview: ASCT+B Reporter Comparison

HuBMAP Atlas Previews demonstrate functionality and resources that will become available in future HuBMAP portal releases. Previews may rely on externally hosted data or analysis results that were generated with processing pipelines that are not yet integrated into the HuBMAP data infrastructure.

### Description

This preview compares experimental data used in the “[Human Digital Twin: Automated Cell Type Distance Computation and 3D Atlas Construction in Multiplexed Skin Biopsies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.30.486438v1)” paper to the anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers in the [skin master ASCT+B table](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-releases/v1.1/docs/asct-b/skin.html).

This so-called ASCT+B Reporter Comparison visualization was designed for different stakeholders:

1. Researchers interested to compare their experimental data with existing ASCT+B master tables to confirm existing anatomical structures (AS), cell types (CT), and biomarkers (B) and identify novel contributions.
2. Atlas designers interested to understand and improve quality and coverage of the [Human Reference Atlas](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00788-6).
3. Editors/Reviewers interested to understand what AS, CT, B a new atlas publication adds.
4. Funders/other decision makers that want to know what old/new AS, CT, B a proposed experiment adds.

The visualization uses the [ASCT+B Reporter](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-asct-reporter) to compare an ASCT+B table that documents all AS, CT, B used in a paper (or proposed experiment) to the most recent ASCT+B Master table.

Specifically, we compare GE Skin data to the skin ASCT+B table, The resulting interactive visualization is shown below.

### Atlas Details

The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) aims to map all of the cells of the human body to advance biomedical research and clinical practice. Please see [Perspective paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00788-6) that presents collaborative work by members of 17 international consortia on two essential and interlinked parts of the HRA:

1. Three-dimensional representations of anatomy that are linked to tables.
2. Tables that name and interlink major anatomical structures, cell types, plus biomarkers (ASCT+B). The paper also discusses four examples that demonstrate the practical utility of the HRA.

### Experimental Data Details

The experimental skin data used here is detailed in “[Human Digital Twin: Automated Cell Type Distance Computation and 3D Atlas Construction in Multiplexed Skin Biopsies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.30.486438v1)” paper.
